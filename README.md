Little program to perform web scraping. 

I've learnt to consume APIs using the requests module. Howerver, not every website has an API for us to work with.
In situations like that, the only way to get the data we want is to parse the html behind the webpage, get rid of 
all the HTML tags, and extract the actual data. This technique is called web scraping. So we scrape all the
HTML tags and extract the data that we want.
